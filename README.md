# Densely

Our project aims in developing a system which could detect the crowd density for a particular image. Image density can be obtained by training neural networks to predict the crowd density. Convolution Neural networks are widely used for image density recognition. We plan to train a Neural network model and then using it to predict the crowd density for different images. We will develop a web application where users can select from a bunch of random images and the back-end will use the trained neural network to predict it's crowd density. Our back-end will be developed in Node.js and will be able to manage multiple requests asynchronously.


### Dataset to train the neural network

The data set used to train the neural network is the PETS 2009 Benchmark Data. Consists video footage of a location form different angels. The data set can be found [here](http://www.cvg.reading.ac.uk/PETS2009/a.html). We get the count for the dataset from [People Counting Data for PETS2009 Dataset](http://visal.cs.cityu.edu.hk/downloads/).
