# Densely

Our project aims in developing a system which could detect the crowd density for a particular image. Image density can be obtained by training neural networks to predict the crowd density. Convolution Neural networks are widely used for image density recognition. We plan to train a Neural network model and then using it to predict the crowd density for different images. We will develop a web application where users can select from a bunch of random images and the back-end will use the trained neural network to predict it's crowd density. Our back-end will be developed in Node.js and will be able to manage multiple requests asynchronously.
