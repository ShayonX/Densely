### Dataset to train the neural network

THe data set used to train the neural network is the PETS 2009 Benchmark Data. Consists video footage of a location form different angels. The data set can be found [here](http://www.cvg.reading.ac.uk/PETS2009/a.html). We get the count for the dataset from [People Counting Data for PETS2009 Dataset](http://visal.cs.cityu.edu.hk/downloads/).
