# Densely

This project aims to develop a system which can detect the crowd density for a particular image. Image density can be obtained by training neural networks to predict the crowd density. Convolution Neural networks are widely used for image density recognition. We have also made use of the OpenCV framework. We will develop a web application where users can select from a bunch of random images and the back-end will use the trained neural network to predict it's crowd density. Our back-end classifier was developed with Python. The middleware was constructed with Node.JS and the front end was created with Jade. We also made use of Bootstrap, Jquery and CSS for styling. We have given a brief list of all the technologies used in this project.
